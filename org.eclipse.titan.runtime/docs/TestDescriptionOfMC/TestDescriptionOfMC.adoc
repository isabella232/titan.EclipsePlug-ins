== Introduction

=== Overview

This document describes how to test the execution of a  Java based Titan project in Eclipse IDE. 
Java based Titan project means that the source code written in ttcn or in java in case of test ports.
The test is restricted for parallel mode.

=== Target Groups

This document is for the tester of the Titan Team.

=== Typographical Conventions

This document uses the following typographical conventions:

* *Bold* is used to represent graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, menus, menu items, dialog box options, fields and keywords, as well as menu commands. Bold is also used with ’+’ to represent key combinations. For example, *Ctrl+Click*
* The "*/*" character is used to denote a menu and sub-menu sequence. For example, *File / Open*.
* `Monospaced` font is used represent system elements such as command and parameter names, program names, path names, URLs, directory names and code examples.
* *`Bold monospaced font`* is used for commands that must be entered at the Command Line Interface (CLI), For example, *`ttcn3_start`*

=== Installation

For details on installing the TITAN Designer for the Eclipse IDE plug-in, see the Installation Guide for TITAN Designer and TITAN Executor for the Eclipse IDE.

=== Prerequisites

* Eclipse IDE with version at least xxx
* Installed titan.EcipsePlug-ins
* A Java based Titan project "HelloJTitan".

==== Test Steps

. Start MC (execute automatically switched off) ( On Run menu, select "HelloJTitan_NativeJavaLaunchCfg_MC", see figure "Run Menu"). 
+
image::images/RunMenu.PNG[title="Run Menu"]
+
The Main controller starts, and its icon appears in the "TITAN Execution Controller view". 
. In Titan Execution Controller view, Select "Start session" on Popup menu of the Main Controller. 
+

Passed

=== TC4 Start the config again

==== Test steps

. Select "Execute..." on the Popup menu of the Main Controller.

==== Status

Passed

=== TC5 Exit MTC

. Select "MTC exit" on the Popup menu of the Main Controller. The MTC stops and statistics will be logged (See figure "MTC Exit" )

==== Reason

Output as expected. HC stops immediately, because MC is not listening yet

=== TC8 Starting MC With Config File Without LocalAddress

This test checks if missing LocalAddress in cfg file causes LocalAddress := 127.0.0.1 or not.

==== Prerequisites
